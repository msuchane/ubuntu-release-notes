## Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish Release Task Signup Sheet

This signup sheet is to be used for planning release milestone tasks.

The Alpha and Beta 1 milestones have been replaced with [Testing Weeks](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2018-April/004434.html), which are organized ad hoc at this point.
